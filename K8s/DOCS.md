### MICROSERVICES

#### SRP (Single Reponsibility Prin)
- Gather together those things that change for the same reason, and separate those things that change for different reasons."
- If one of the service goes down the other will work


#### Microservices
- Small (2 Pizza team, 2 Weeks to build)
- Responsible for doing 1 thing well
- Organisationally alligned
- Form Part of the (distributed) whole
- Self-Contained / Autonomous

#### True Story (Why Microservice)
- I Know of large monolithic CRM System, that:
1. Services Millions of Customs
2. Evolved Over Many years
3. Built on a Single, proprietary tech stack
4. Managed by 1 "out-sourced" partner

#### This System is...
- Very difficult to change
- - change cycles are months in duration
- - Massive amounts of (frequently manual) testing
- Difficult to Scale
- Locked in
- - Technolgy terms
- - Intellectual property terms (an external party held the cards)

#### Benefits of Microservices
- Easier to change & deploy (small and decoupled)
- Can be built using different technologies
- Increated Organisational ownership and alignment (Outsourcing some of the project)
- Resilient: 1 Service can break the, others will continue to run
- Scalable: you can scale out only the servicies you need to
- Built to be highly replaceable / swappable
